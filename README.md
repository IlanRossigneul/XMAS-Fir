# XMAS-Fir

#### Project realized in one day at the end of two weeks of learning in C at the Coding Academy by Epitech.

We were asked to draw a tree based on an integer argument entered (if 0 or null, do not display anything).
I chose to add color and an "animation" of garland with an infinite loop.

To display the XMAS Fir, enter *./sapin* command on your terminal followed by an integer.
